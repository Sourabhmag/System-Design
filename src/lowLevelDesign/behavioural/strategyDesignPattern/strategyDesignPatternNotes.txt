	Why Use the Strategy Design Pattern?

	The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of interchangeable algorithms, encapsulate each one, 
	and make them interchangeable at runtime. Here’s why it’s valuable:

		1) Avoid Hard-Coding Algorithms:
			Decouples algorithm implementation from the client code, allowing flexibility in choosing algorithms at runtime.

		2) Promote Open/Closed Principle:
			New strategies can be added without modifying existing code (open for extension, closed for modification).

		3) Eliminate Conditional Statements:
			Replaces complex conditional logic (e.g., if-else or switch blocks) with polymorphic strategy objects.

		4) Improve Code Maintainability:
			Each strategy is isolated in its own class, making it easier to test, debug, and reuse.

		5) Runtime Flexibility:
			Clients can dynamically switch between algorithms based on context (e.g., user input, environment, or configuration).

	When to Use the Strategy Pattern?
		1) Multiple Algorithm Variants:
			When you need multiple implementations of an algorithm (e.g., sorting, payment methods, compression algorithms).

		2) Avoid Monolithic Classes:
			When a class has many conditional statements that alter its behavior.

		3) Isolate Business Logic:
			When you want to separate algorithmic logic from the client that uses it (e.g., third-party integrations).

		4) Runtime Algorithm Selection:
			When the choice of algorithm depends on external factors (e.g., configuration, user preferences, or data type).
		
	Key Takeaways : 
		1) Use the Strategy Pattern when you need to decouple an algorithm from its usage, support multiple variants of an algorithm, 
			or reduce conditional complexity.
		2) Avoid It for simple scenarios where the algorithm is unlikely to change or when over-engineering would add unnecessary complexity.
		
	Real-World Examples:
		1) Java’s Comparator interface for sorting.
		2) Payment gateways with multiple methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.).
		3) Navigation apps with routing strategies (fastest, shortest, scenic).
